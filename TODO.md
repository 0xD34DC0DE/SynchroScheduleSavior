# Bugs
- [ ] Injected functions that do not return a value result in a timeout error since the event is never fired

# Improvements
- [ ] Add a way to inject a function that takes parameters (make sure the parameters are serialized)
- [ ] Add a mouse jiggle to prevent website from logging out
- [ ] Provide a way to automatically log in to the website (just for development purposes)

# Base functionality
- [ ] javascript library injection like jquery
- [ ] Injection state object on "window" object to prevent multiple injections of the same library
